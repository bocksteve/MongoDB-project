# MongoDB-project

A school project I built with a partner using MongoDB and PyMongo.  We ran several queries on a large (15+ million lines) dataset.
The shell script was run to import the data into a Mongo database, and then ran the db_proj.py file to show the queries.  We timed execution of the queries, generally all together they would take around 80 seconds.
